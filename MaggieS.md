I will enjoy this Solidity learning journey going through one step by one step as a fresher. It’s a chance to dive deeper into block-chain world, which lights me up so much. Wish I could learn and understand not only just the syntax, but also a big picture and the actual underlying concepts of how to program. 

This Solidity learning undertaking is divided into three steps in accordance with my goal in this 21-day journey:

Step1:  Initiation     5days 

1.1 Going through overall 50 chapters and complete every test with a score of 100.
1.2 Drawing at least four mind-map of the Solidity tutorials.
1.3 Marking difficulties and doubts of the tutorial details.

Step2:  Orientation   14days

2.1 Summarizing and generalizing the learning difficulties in Step1.
2.2 Categorizing of issues and details into different themes to learn.
2.3 Learning the difficulties using QA way (answer at least two questions everyday).

Step3:  Summary    2 days

3.1 Checking and filling the gaps in Step2.
3.2 Figuring out again all the test questions in Beta of tutorials.
3.3 Mapping my own questions into a mind map.
